# UNI EATS – Full Project Skeleton

This repo contains a **completed React frontend** and **placeholder backend/database**
folders that follow the UNI EATS requirement analysis.

- `frontend/` – fully styled React single-page app (search + filter UI)
- `backend/` – Flask skeleton with placeholder routes and config
- `database/` – draft PostgreSQL schema

## Running the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app will start in development mode at http://localhost:3000.

## Backend & DB

The backend and database folders are intentionally minimal placeholders.
You can gradually wire the React UI to real Flask endpoints and PostgreSQL models.
